# dgt_hum_140
Final project for DGT HUM 140 by Abishan Sutharshan. This repository contains the finalproject.ipynb at the root, which is the notebook I used to analyze the data and make claims based on my analysis. I also included links to my external research sources in that notebook. The files pertaining to my research are the .csv files and the singular .xlsx file. All other files are attempts to deploy my notebook to Quarto and Jekyll through the use of GitHub Actions.

**Potential Final Project Ideas**
A question that I want to answer through the research for my final project is "How can data trends help build a strong, truthful claim?" Through my research, I want to be careful of accidentally portraying misinformation or a false narrative with data analysis. The research idea that I have the strongest interest in is the "Death in US jails" dataset. The dataset is very large, with death data from different county prisons per state. My plan is to analyze only a subset of California counties and see what the trend shows. Some potential claims that could be made are how certain prisons are strict with the wellness of inmates, while others are not. Moreover, certain prisons may have an increase in deaths, which could mean that certain laws (regarding prison management) became lax.

Final Project Assignment #2 update: my topic of interest is deaths in California jails specifically, which is taken from the Death in US Jails dataset by Reuters. The question of interest is "What are the leading factors that influence death tolls in California jails and how can they be mitigated?" This will be investigated in my finalproject.ipynb.
